					<p class="titletextf h1">Civilizaed races</p>
					<p class="titletextf h2">Human</p>
					<p>Humans are humanoid creatures, that have two legs and two arms, two ears, eyes, one nose with two nostrils and one mouth with 32 teeth inside. Modern apes and humans have a common ancestor, but unlike apes, humans are not as hairy on the body, except for heads, faces, armpits and crotch. Humans have different kinds of skin colors, from white to brown and rarely dark-grey, due to breeding with other civilized species. Their eye color can also vary from blue to green and hazel, rarely some can be coal-black or snow white - again due to gene inheritance from other races.</p>
					<p>Humans are the most numerous species of all civilized creatures. They are populating every known kingdom on the Continent and probably even live somewhere beyond it.</p>
					<p class="titletextf h2">Elf</p>
					<p>Elves are humanoids, like humans they share the common ancestor with apes, but elves' ancestors lives in an enclosed island, back when it was separated from the Continent by sea. Through millenia, island travelled and one time it was so close to the Comninent, that ancient elves could swim or walk over the frozen sea to it. Elves are considered the same species as humans but of being a distinguishable different race.</p>
					<p>Anatomy of the modern elf is pretty much the same as of the modern human with the exception that they are naturally slightly taller, slimmer and have pointy ears and no fangs. Their skin color can vary from light-green to pale white.</p>
					<p>Elves came to the continent from the west, the biggest community of elves are in Kingdom of Alzuria, the northernmost kingdom.</p>
					<p class="titletextf h2">Faun</p>
					<p>Shorter than a regular human, fauns bear bull- or goat-like horns, with highly furry legs ending with hooves. Most fauns have small furry tails similar to those of goats. Most male fauns have thin bull-like horns, females bear goat-like thin and sometimes short horns.</p>
					<p>Long time ago fauns travelled everywhere in the Continent, the ancient settlements are scattered basically everywhere. If you think you're new to this place, it's more likely than long time ago some faun was also here, admiring the views. This is the main reason why faun can be found in alsome every city and there's no particular place or their own kingdom where they are the majority.</p>
					<p class="titletextf h2">Airex</p>
					<p>A mammal humanoid. Airexes and Faus have a common ancestor. The difference is that airex sturdier and taller that fauns, a bit taller than humans. They have different shades of skin, due to millenia of living with other races, from pale white to brown, dark grey and yellowish beige. All airexes bear grand thick horns, some similar to antlers of deer and elks, some similar to rams and ibexes. Bodies of male airexes are more hairy than those of females. But anatomically both os them sturdies and more muscular than bodies of humans. Unlike faun they don't have tails and their lover body is not as hairy and has no hooves.</p>
					<p>Traditionally it is common for men and women of that species to decorate their horns and ears with silver piercings. Due to natural resistance to cold, airexes prefer living in colder regions. Largest number of them living in Alzuria and in villages around it.</p>
					<p class="titletextf h2">Apiad</p>
					<p>Apiads and modern honey-bees have a common ancestor. This ancestor was a large insect, whose genes got mixed with human or other kinds of humanoid. This is how apiads came into being.</p>
					<p>Modern apiads, depending on the region, have different anatomical body structure. That's because tribes separated over the wide continent got different features over the span of millenia. All of them taller or the same size as an average human. They bear yellowish or dark-grey skin. Their eyes are slightly bigger than that of humans, and are pitch-black. Ears are just holes on the side of the pointy head. Close to none of them retained wings.</p>
					<p>All apiads have bee-like abdomen behind their back, growing from the upper sacrum, that is 1,5 feet thick and hangs lower than a knee. Like those of bees, reproductive organs are located at the tip of it. Female apiads lay eggs. Apiads prefer warmer climates, their skin thicker and firmer compared to human's. Largest community of apiads located to the south of The Scar.
					<p class="titletextf h2">Goblin</p>
					<p>Being decendant of ancient elves, goblins were one of the tribes of elves that stayed in the travelling island, enclosed in it for millenia. Living there for a long period of time changes their anatomy, making them smaller. The average size of a goblin is almost half as tall as the human. They retained pointy ears and their skin grew even more greener, now varying from deep green, to darker green with shades of yellow, brown and red.</p>
					<p>Centuries ago, goblins were introduced to the Continent, where they discovered many species, all of whom was taller than them! They travelled everywhere, but it's very rare to see a goblin in a southern parts of the Continent. In some of the furtherest regions of the Continent they still considered to be a mere legend, characters from fairy-tales.</p>
					<p class="titletextf h2">Demon</p>
					<p>The portals to Helath are opened. The great Comet brought the light and magic to this World. Archaelogist that study the Evercity say that a long time ago, a great wizard harnessed the energy bestowed upon the World by a the Comet and conjured a portal tho the damned realm of the underworld, realm of suffering, the Helath. From it various creatures appeared and one of those species were demons.</p>
					<p>Demons are humanoid species with a dark-red or dark-grey skin. They have long tails and some bear bull-like horns. Their eyes are of glowing red color. Altought there are tales about demons that suggest that they are in their hearts are evil, seeking to destroy all living beings of the World, it is not true. Being introduced to the Continent, demons try to lead a simple and decent life, though tensions are still there, when a demon enters a town...</p>
					<p>Most demons live in a repopulated districts of the Evercity, but some travelled around the Continent and settled in various places.</p>
