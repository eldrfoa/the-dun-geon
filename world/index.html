					<p class="titletextf h1">Civilizaed races</p>
					<p class="titletextf h2">Human</p>
					<p>Humans are humanoid creatures, that have two legs and two arms, two ears, eyes, one nose with two nostrils and one mouth with 32 teeth inside, and are about 5'5 feet tall. Modern apes and humans have a common ancestor, but unlike apes, humans are not as hairy on the body, except for heads, faces, armpits and crotch. Humans have different kinds of skin colors, from white to brown and rarely dark-grey, due to breeding with other civilized species. Their eye color can also vary from blue to green and hazel, rarely some can be coal-black or snow white - again due to gene inheritance from other races.</p>
					<p>Humans are the most numerous species of all civilized creatures. They are populating every known kingdom on the Continent and probably even live somewhere beyond it.</p>
					<p class="titletextf h2">Elf</p>
					<p>Elves are humanoids, like humans they share the common ancestor with apes, but elves' ancestors lives in an enclosed island, back when it was separated from the Continent by sea. Through millenia, island travelled and one time it was so close to the Comninent, that ancient elves could swim or walk over the frozen sea to it. Elves are considered the same species as humans but of being a distinguishable different race.</p>
					<p>Anatomy of the modern elf is pretty much the same as of the modern human with the exception that they are naturally slightly taller, slimmer and have pointy ears and no fangs. Their skin color can vary from light-green to pale white.</p>
					<p>Elves came to the continent from the west, the biggest community of elves are in Kingdom of Alzuria, the northernmost kingdom.</p>
					<p class="titletextf h2">Faun</p>
					<p>Shorter than a regular human, fauns bear bull- or goat-like horns, with highly furry legs ending with hooves. Most fauns have small furry tails similar to those of goats. Most male fauns have thin bull-like horns, females bear goat-like thin and sometimes short horns.</p>
					<p>Long time ago fauns travelled everywhere in the Continent, the ancient settlements are scattered basically everywhere. If you think you're new to this place, it's more likely than long time ago some faun was also here, admiring the views. This is the main reason why faun can be found in alsome every city and there's no particular place or their own kingdom where they are the majority.</p>
					<p class="titletextf h2">Airex</p>
					<p>A mammal humanoid. Airexes and Faus have a common ancestor. The difference is that airex sturdier and taller that fauns, a bit taller than humans. They have different shades of skin, due to millenia of living with other races, from pale white to brown, dark grey and yellowish beige. All airexes bear grand thick horns, some similar to antlers of deer and elks, some similar to rams and ibexes. Bodies of male airexes are more hairy than those of females, but anatomically bodies of regular airex men and women sturdier and more muscular than bodies of humans. Unlike fauns they don't have tails and their lover body is not as hairy and instead of hooves - feet with 5 fingers each.</p>
					<p>Traditionally it is common for men and women of this species to decorate their horns and ears with silver piercings. Due to natural resistance to cold, airexes prefer living in colder regions. Largest number of them living in Alzuria and in villages and small kingdoms around it.</p>
					<p class="titletextf h2">Apiad</p>
					<p>Apiads and modern honey-bees have a common ancestor. This ancestor was a large insect, whose genes got mixed with human or other kinds of humanoid. This is how apiads came into being.</p>
					<p>Modern apiads, depending on the region, have different anatomical body structure. That's because tribes separated over the wide continent got different features over the span of millenia. All of them taller or the same size as an average human. They bear yellowish or dark-grey skin. Their eyes are slightly bigger than that of humans, and are pitch-black. Ears are just holes on the side of the pointy hairy head. Close to none of them retained wings.</p>
					<p>All apiads have bee-like abdomen behind their back, growing from the upper sacrum, that is 1,5 feet thick and hangs lower than a knee. Like those of bees, reproductive organs are located at the tip of it. Female apiads lay eggs. Apiads prefer warmer climates, their skin thicker and firmer compared to human's. Largest community of apiads located to the south of The Scar in the Throne Empire.
					<p class="titletextf h2">Goblin</p>
					<p>Being decendant of ancient elves, goblins were one of the tribes of elves that stayed in the travelling island, enclosed in it for millenia. Living there for a long period of time changed their anatomy, making them smaller. The average size of a goblin is almost half as tall as the human. They retained pointy ears and their skin grew even more greener, now varying from deep green, to darker green with shades of yellow, brown and red.</p>
					<p>Centuries ago, goblins were introduced to the Continent, where they discovered many species, all of whom was taller than them! They travelled everywhere, but it's very rare to see a goblin in a southern parts of the Continent. In some of the furtherest regions of the Continent they still considered to be a mere legend, characters from fairy-tales.</p>
					<p class="titletextf h2">Demon</p>
					<p>The portals to Helath are opened. The great Comet brought light and magic to this World. Archaelogists that study the Evercity say that a long time ago, a great wizard harnessed the energy bestowed upon the World by a the Comet and conjured a portal to the damned realm of the underworld, realm of suffering, the Helath. From it various creatures appeared and one of those species were demons.</p>
					<p>Demons are humanoid species with a dark-red or dark-grey skin. They have long tails and some bear bull-like horns. Their eyes are of glowing red color. Altought there are tales about demons that suggest that they are in their hearts are evil, seeking to destroy all living beings of the World, it is not true. Being introduced to the Continent, demons try to lead a simple and decent life, though tensions are still there, when a demon enters a town...</p>
					<p>Most demons live in a repopulated districts of the Evercity, but some travelled around the Continent and settled in various places.</p>

					<p class="titletextf h1">Kingdoms</p>
					<p class="titletextf h2">The Kingdom of Alzuria</p>
					<p>Alias: Alzuria, The Northern Kingdom</p>
					<p>Places: Verata, NÃµeta, Botho, Hanle, Bissma, Evercity</p>
					<p>Language: Common (northern dialect), Elvish</p>
					<p>One of the great kingdoms that is located of the north of the Continent. Long time ago while expanding free settlers of an ancient kingdom discovered a strange city. External walls of it were of polished rock about 230 feet in height. Scouts were sent to find an entrance, but after weeks of traveling along the ancient walls, they found no entrances, windows nor any sort of openings. Primitive copper and iron tools of those settlers could not penetrate the walls, so the mystery of that place remained for a very long time. People who lived near the walls noticed that when comes the time of the Comet and it is seen closest to the World, the walls start emitting strange buzzing sound and even tremble. Later, when elves arrived to the Continent, they settles the northern parts of it. Noticing the great walls, they also tried to penetrate them, having discovered blacksmithing and steel-working, their tools were a tad better at digging the walls. Still it took them a few years to make an hole in the external wall, them being about 70 feet thick. To the other side of those great walls was a city with giant buildings with many windows, of strange architecture and building material. Peoples of kingdom of Alzuria came to settle the first district, trying to live in those alien houses, research weird tools that they'd found in there.</p>
					<p>Capital of the Alzuria is Verata, located south to Evercity. Majority of the kingdom is humans and elves, so it is not uncommon to see elf, human or even half-elf half-human ruler of the throne of Alzuria. This kingdom formed by northerners who willed to research Evercity, most of its time Alzuria never been in war with other kingdoms. So before portals of Helath there was the most peaceful life. After the portals were opened, Aluzria suffered the most from the outbreak of otherworldly creatures and initial tensions with demon kind. Occasional battles and racism towards them was a common thing back then. Now peoples of Alzuria proud to say that there is the long peace and prosperity in their kingdom.</p>
					<p class="titletextf h2">The Kingdom of HÃµeginn</p>
					<p>Alias: HÃµeginn, The Scar</p>
					<p>Places: Cross, Fenn-town, Dethmold, HÃµedr, Sarr, Silveris</p>
					<p>Language: Common, Old-Common</p>
					<p>Kingdom of HÃµeginn located to the south of the kingdom of Alzuria. At the heart of that kingdom there is a long narrow canyon that stretched from east to west, from northers forests to great ocean. Hills around the canyon and a wide river that flows at the bottom make it look as a gutter or a freshly cut scar. That's how this region got its name and later, when kingdom of HÃµeginn was established, its nickname. Somewhere in the middle of that canyon peoples of the old kingdoms build a wide stone road that crossed the Scar and went further from south to north. City that was build on the canyon river by that road was named Cross and now is a capital of HÃµeginn. Some may argue that building a city in the lowland is dangerous, but wideness on that canyon's region makes up for it. And the kingdom itself is not enclosed in the Scar, regions around it also controlled by it and a lot of fortresses spread evenly in the south of the scar and in the north.</p>
					<p>This kingdom is located at the heart of the Continent, many races traveling to distant lands make their way through it. Population of it is quite numerous and diverse. City of Sarr in located by the ocean-side, has a warm climate and heavily populated by apiads. Silveris and HÃµedr to the north in the forest could get very cold in winters and are favorite place to travel or settle down for airexes and humans. This is one of the places where people speak old-common language and it's dialects, Old-Common was of course the language of ancient fauns. Over the years, when old kingdoms risen, people of the Continent agreed on using the simplified version of the Old-Common that is now referred to as simply "Common". Current king of the HÃµeginn is an old faun, who rules along with his young wife, queen SvevÃ¤.</p>
					<p class="titletextf h2">Empire of Throne</p>
					<p>Alias: Throne Empire, Empire, Burning Empire</p>
					<p>Places: Throne, Caracalla, Twaedir, Polod, Goldplace, Yanvick, Coatter</p>
					<p>Language: Common (eastern dialect)</p>
					<p>Few centuries ago to the east of the Kingdom of HÃµeginn there was three small kingdoms. The kingdom of Caracalla to the south by the ocean that traded seafood with others and was a relatively wealthy state. The chiefdom of Yanvick in the forest region to the north-east that traded furs and meat. The kingdom of Twaedir to south-east of The Scar. In Tweadir there was an old king, whose rule was fragile. Internal conflicts and conspiracy weakened the integrity of the country. This was the time when Reveanon, a young human aristocrat, came to conceal a plot against the king. With his unnatural charisma he had gathered among himself the most influential people in the country and overthrew the king, seizing the power. To unify the nation and gain more lands and wealth, Reveanon called out to the worshiping to one of the old gods of the south region of Twaedir. The belief if the Burning God. Reveanon gave up his family's banner and made his own - a head of a man engulfed in flames. This banner became the flag of The kingdom of Twaedir. With that religion, Reveanon started a campaign to convince his own people to wage wars and reclaim the lands that once belonged to the Burning God. Of course, those lands was other eastern kingdoms, far wealthier and prosperous than that of Reveanon. After a few years of non-stop campaigns against the neighboring kingdoms, Reveanon finally annexed them all, unifying the East under his banner. Reveanon called his country "Empire of Throne", because Throne was the capital of Twaedir, although after his death people started calling it "The Burning Empire" unofficially and Reveanon got the nickname "The Fierce". During his life as the emperor, Reveanon spent large sums of money to enforce worship to this forgotten religion. Temples of other gods were removed, new temples of the Burning God was erected. More over, a vast amount of gold was spent to strengthen the army. Other countries, that neighbored Throne Empire started to worry about safety, doubling the defenses on their borders. But life of Reveanon the Fierce ended prematurely, all money that he had spent on military were wasted, next rulers were not as warmongering as he was. The borders of the Empire remained as they was for the next centuries. </p>
					<p>Empire of Throne is a south country, so it has a lot of warm-loving races. The majority is the humans - about two third of them live there. A lot of apiads and fauns live in large communities in almost all the cities. Modern government with the old emperor Hevo the Second is  quite conservative, having good relations with other kingdoms. Empire's banner still bears a burning head of a man on a white field, a tradition carried over centuries.</p>
